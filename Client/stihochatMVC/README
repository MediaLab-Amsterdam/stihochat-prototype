Readme File for StihoAntwoord App Prototype

 * Developed by ClickSmash for MediaLAB Amsterdam
 * Developer: Brian Sahertian
 * 
 * Development started on May 11, 2013
 * Last updated: June 18, 2013
 * Version: 1.2 Fase 3.1
 * 
 * This prototype is based on the flowchart, wireframes and initial designs that were provided by
 * MediaLAB. This prototype only simulates the functionality, except for the chat which will 
 * be partially functional (it will allow sending and receiving simple text, audio and photo messages)
 
This app was written in Titanium Appcelerator in order to deploy this to both iOS and Android from (almost) the same code base.
The app uses the Alloy MVC model to structure the code. It should work with Titanium Appcelerator 3.x and up.

The prototype is currently limited to controllers, views (and styles). The actual app should be extended with models as well.
