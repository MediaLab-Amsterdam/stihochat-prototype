This initial prototype server is very basic to support simulation in the prototype of the client app.
Please not that it is not secured and optimized for performance at all.

The audiogateway sends the right HTTP headers for the recorded AIF files. Downloading the file directly from the app may cause problems in the client when using NGINX or Apache.

a. Place all the .php files in the webroot of your webserver
